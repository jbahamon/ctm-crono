Crono is a three-button character (a+b+c keys) made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)
- 12p mode

## Moveset

Crono is intended to be a somewhat of a rushdown character that has to stay 
close to the opponent to deal damage. 

The following are his special moves:

### Lightning: `D, B, DB + a/b/c` (Ground)

Crono summons a lightning from the sky. The button used determines the 
position of the lightning.

### Cyclone: `D, DF, F, + a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

Crono advances while spinning. The button used determines his movement speed.

### **Spincut**: `D, F, DF + a/b/c` (Ground)

Crono jumps into the air and swings his katana. Has some invincibility frames 
on startup. Button determines the jump's height.


### **Volt Hit**: `D, DB, B + a/b/c` (Ground) 

Requires 250 Power. Crono hits itself with lightning. A small spark will float 
near him and he will glow with energy. 

Performing one of the previous special moves will consume the spark and improve
the move in some way. Additionally, as long as he's glowing, Crono has super 
armor for the next hit he takes. Both effects are independent.

The following are his supermoves:

### **Luminaire**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Crono floats and casts Luminaire around him.
    
### **Thundastorm**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Crono summons many lightning strikes in front of him.

### **Confuse**: `D, B, D, F + a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Crono jumps and performs his Confuse attack if it hits 
the enemy, hitting multiple times. This is technically a throw.

### Special Mode: **Frenzy**: `a + c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Crono gains invulnerable afterimages that follow him and
copy each of his normal attacks. Crono's Power will deplete automatically: 
when he runs out of Power, the mode ends.

### **Shining Sword Attack**: `D, F, D, B + a/b/c` (Ground while Frenzy is active)

Spends all remaining Power. A super throw. Crono charges up electrical energy and
advances towards its opponent. If the hit connects, he will launch them into the air 
before delivering a series of quick slashes, finishing with a huge lightning blast from his hand.
